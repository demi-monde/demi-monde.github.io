        <p> This product of generative poetry uses potential combinations of many algorithms to create an unpredictable poem. The site is designed for cutting and recombining the language using code developed by Nick Montfort. This code allows anyone who
            uses it become a poet a bit. It is enough to substitute your words in certain places of this code.</p>
        <p>The content is dictated by the book of Alexandre Dumas "Camille". This story inspired the author in choosing the words that formed this random poem. The fate of Margaret Gautier has been worrying readers, viewers, artists, composers, directors
            for more than one hundred and fifty years. Her character was embodied by the great actresses - Sarah Bernhardt and Greta Garbo. Giuseppe Verdi wrote world famous "La Traviata" about her. Depraved and virtuous, cold-blooded and gentle, prudent
            and disinterested, Dumas's heroine always remains surprisingly modern, even though those times have long since sunk into oblivion. </p>
        <p>The words that were selected for this work are related to the content of the novel, but do not reflect it in the final version. It was chosen twenty nouns and adjectives in honor of the date of death of the heroine - February 20. </p>
        <p>This work is based on the generation of an artistic text not only as a method of creating a work, but also as an independent artistic expression, where the code is a random author, generating thoughts that can not come to the human's head, because
            of associative links and past experience, which is inevitable connects it. So, with the help of these lines of code the reader tries to comprehend and analyze the generative poetic text. May be someone will find here a good answer, and another
            may find here a good question.</p>
